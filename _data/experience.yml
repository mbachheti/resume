# 2023 Summer Internship
- company: Selector Software
  position: Software Engineer Intern
  duration: July 2023 &mdash; August 2023
  summary: Over the course of my 2 months as a software engineer intern at Selector, I completed one project. My project consisted of creating a new service to collect metrics data from Google Cloud Platform and display them in Selector's eexisting dashboard. The service allowed metrics in Google Cloud Platform to be displayed and visualized alongside Selector's other metrics in their dashboard. My project was used by the company after the completion of my internship in a demo of Selector's product to a potential customer. #<ul class="resume-item-list"><li>A project you are proud of</li><li>Another awesome project</li><li>or a team or department you worked with</li></ul>
